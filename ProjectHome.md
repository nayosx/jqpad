jQPad is an iPad web development framework which makes iPad compatible websites easy! It uses jQuery and some awesome CSS techniques. Its very easily theme-able and also has some features which makes life for iPad development so much easier!

## Upcoming Features ##
  * iPad Hovering Bubble
  * Databases, offline (Already in Safari, but more user friendly)
  * Caching

Google code is only a temporary home for jQPad, once it takes off, we'll be moving to a more permanent, comfy home on a VPS server located somewhere in Hawaii.

## Questions & Answers ##
**Why isn't the a minified version of jQPad?**
jQPad is still in it early beta stage. Once we have a good, stable release, in beta or not, it will come packaged minified.

**I want to help! How can I?**
Once jQPad gets fully up and running, there will be a dedicated team to help expand and contribute on the frameworlk, but for now, it's a one man job.

**How can I donate to this wonderful project?**
You can't. Well, not as yet, I want to actually package a framework that is _worth_ donating towards and as of yet, jQPad sadly is not up to that standard _yet_.
